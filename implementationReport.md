# Implementation Report

## Features Implemented

- Parsed the provided CSV file using `csv-parser` in Express.js.
- Created a REST API endpoint `/api/data` to return CSV data as JSON.
- Fetched this data in the frontend using Redux Toolkit with an async thunk.
- Used Tailwind CSS to style the table based on the Figma layout.
- Connected Redux state to a dynamic table component that renders rows and headers based on the dataset.
- The entire page matches the design specification for the main content section only.

## Development Notes and Decisions

- Used TypeScript in the frontend, as the default `create-next-app` template with Tailwind generated `.tsx` files. TypeScript helps with maintainability and error prevention.
- Chose to display the data in a responsive table, as no specific chart or graph visualization was shown in the Figma design.
- Ensured that all application logic and rendering occurred within a single page per the project scope.

## Technical Trade-offs

- Avoided MongoDB or Supabase integration, as no database functionality was needed.
- Did not implement client-side or server-side pagination since the CSV was static and relatively small.
- Opted not to deploy the project since deployment was not explicitly required.
